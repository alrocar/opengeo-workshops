OpenLayers complete exercise

 BASICS 30' (Map configuration and controls)
     +Set projection to EPSG:900913 and displayProjection to EPSG:4326
     +Restrict the map extent of the map to a bounding box (coordinates must be in EPSG:900913)
     +Add two raster layers as overlays:
			*an OSM layer using this URLs
			var arrayOSM = ["http://otile1.mqcdn.com/tiles/1.0.0/osm/${z}/${x}/${y}.jpg",
        "http://otile2.mqcdn.com/tiles/1.0.0/osm/${z}/${x}/${y}.jpg",
        "http://otile3.mqcdn.com/tiles/1.0.0/osm/${z}/${x}/${y}.jpg",
        "http://otile4.mqcdn.com/tiles/1.0.0/osm/${z}/${x}/${y}.jpg"];

			 *The states WMS layer from geoserver

     +Set tilesize to 512 * 512
     +Set the states WMS layer singleTile property to true (see the different labeling options)
     +Set the transparency of the mapquest layer to 50%
     +Add the layerswitcher
     +Avoid the OSM layer to appear in the layerSwitcher
     +Add the zoombox control
     +Add the mouseposition control

 MEDIUM 1h (Adding vector layers and advanced controls)
     +Add a gml layer with projection: "EPSG:4326"
		Take it from: data/europe.gml
     +Add a kml layer with projection: "EPSG:4326"
     	Take it from: data/global_undersea.kml
     +Add two wfs layers (polygons and points) with projection: "EPSG:4326"
        states and cities layers from geoserver
     +Add the editing toolbar
     +Change the position and/or theme of the layerswitcher
     +Add the DynamicMeasure control from the extras folder. Configure it to measure distances and areas
     +Add buttons for switching distance and area measure controlsÂ´
     	You will need to add an OpenLayers.Control.Panel, and define the displayClass of the DynamicMeasureControl. Also create those styles with CSS
     +Add the FeaturePopup control from the extras folder and configure it for the cities layer
     	You'll need to define templates. See the documentation of the FeaturePopup Control

 ADVANCED +2h (Styling)
     +Filter wfs: Filter countries of the states layer with a MALE population greater than 700000
     +Set the stylemap of the citiesLayer
			Add a "default" and a "select style", a label and fillColors
     +Register to the 'featureselected' event of the states layer and show an alert with the ID of the feature
     +Context styling
     	Add a context object in the cities layer styleMap, so the pointRadius is proportional to the population of each city
     +Create a function to add unique values styles to a layer given its name and a feature attribute name. Apply it to the gml layer, with the property 'UN'
     +Use a AnimatedClusterStrategy in the points layer
     +Rules
